## Intro

> This project was designed to increase productivity and maintain consistency.

When I thought on this project its because boilerplate it's something boring and we spend a lot of time coding. If we had a system where we memorize ours best packages and rebuild them with one command? 

There is in big companies, but the most of developers will write/copy many times these boilerplates.

Imagine if you need create an e-commerce or a blog or maybe a rent site, all of these need a login system. So we can build a package login with all best practices and memorize its, only once.

And always we need use a login system, it's only use one command and rebuild all of code wrote before.

beyond it's possible export yours templates in github to use on another computer.

## Tech review

Main feactures:

* **F1** - Memorize a folder or a file.
* **F2** - Rebuild a template memorized.
* **F3** - Export yours templates to git.


### Functional requirements

* **RF1** - Memorize and build whatever kind of file.
* **RF2** - Ensure that there is only one project for each alias.
* **RF3** - Useful on whatever terminal.
