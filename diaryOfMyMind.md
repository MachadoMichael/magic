I want to the first thing its look inside the file mapping.json if exist some key as same value, if its is true return a message to user and error's log. If false create this key with value equal a infoMap setting path to folder inside templates folder and time.Now().

Before that I will copy files in parameter path and create this new folder inside templates/customized folder.

For while copying file save the amount of files.
